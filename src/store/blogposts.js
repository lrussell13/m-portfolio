    It has now been over a month since I got on a plane and flew to Dominican Republic. Lots of people told me I was crazy for going. Many Americans were dying there. Few of us were teaming up. Oh, and we barely knew each other!

    Needless to say, I had a wonderful time serving abroad and have made impactful memories.

    The organization my group served with was called Mission of Hope (1). The founder is originally from Austin, TX and saw a great need in Haiti when he witnessed a mother's baby die on the way to a faraway hospital during his visit. Mission of Hope now has mobile clinics, schools and even an orphanage in Haiti. However, due to the political tensions arising in Haiti, the American team members had to pull out of Haiti temporarily and are now relocating to Dominican Republic to help the Haitian immigrant population.

    Much of my group's work in Dominican Republic was spent fostering relationships with the locals and gathering data to see what sorts of needs are present. When visiting the homes appointed by our leader, Pastor Alex, we noticed clean drinking water was a scarcity. Some of the locals developed kidney stones and other health complications due to the unclean water they were drinking. Fortunately, we were able to deliver water pumps to a few homes with the hope of giving them a fresh relief.

    Another common problem in the villages was access to health care. Because much of the Haitian population was illegal immigrants, up to half a million (2), they were unable to go to the hospital when the need arose. The lady suffering kidney stones was told that the doctor wasn't able to see her when she went to the hospital and to come back in 3 months, likely with the same candid response next time.

    The racial division between the Haitians and Dominicans was hard to overlook. Haitians had trouble finding jobs and were often confined to their homes out of fear that the police would come and deport them. It was devastating to hear stories of Haitians who came to Dominican Republic for a better life and had to leave their families behind, only to be faced with persecution and woes. It definitely opened my eyes even more to the racial divide happening right now in our back yard.

    What's amazing is that despite all the difficulties these people faced, they still held on to hope! Because many of those we visited attended Pastor Alex's church, they were already believers. Oh how their faith was rooted deep like an oak tree. What would cause us Americans to throw a petty fit and slump in our unfairness, caused these people to unite together and keep their eyes fixed on a higher power.

    As Emily Dickinson said, “Hope is the thing with feathers That perches in the soul And sings the tune without the words And never stops at all.” There may not be any answers right now, but keep pushing forward and don't give up.
